# UFOs!
# Project Overview:
Our company was asked to help Dana provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. We added filtered datas on the tables given different city, state, country and shapes.

The website can be reachable at index.html

# conclusion:
The website could have been better if there was a CLEAR button, as the actual data remains still. Also, we need to make a better filtering options , for new user it will be hard to figure out which input to put into the system to get the datas involved.
